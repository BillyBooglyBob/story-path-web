StoryPath is a location experience platform designed to allow users
to create and explore virtual museum exhibits, location-based tours,
and treasure hunts with clues.

The platform features a Web app built in React that enables users to
author these experiences, and a React Native Player for deploying
them, making it easy to bring location-driven narratives to life.

This project is the Web app.
